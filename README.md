# Web-Based-Savings-and-Loan-Cooperative-Management-Application
This project is a web application designed to digitize and streamline the daily operations of a savings and loan cooperative. The application is built with a strong focus on security, efficiency, and user-friendliness by implementing a strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system for each manager and member.
